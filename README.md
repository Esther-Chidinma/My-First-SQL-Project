SQL Capstone Project using PostgreSQL
For my student capstone project, I leveraged PostgreSQL to analyze data. This project focused on:

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Writing queries to extract key insights.

✅ Complex SQL Queries: Using joins, window functions, and aggregation for in-depth analysis.

✅ Performance Optimization: Implementing indexing and query optimization for efficiency.
